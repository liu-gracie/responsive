                    "Mikel and myself, we are very close with each other. When he came two years ago he told me exactly what I wanted to hear. I was missing a coach like this, very warm, very open, very clear, the clear ideas he had, and yeah he was always behind me, doesn't matter what other people were speaking about it." 

                    "I want to give Mikel something back because he was always the guy who supports me."

                    Granit Xhaka on Mikel Arteta: 

                    "Tactically he knows everything. How the team prepares before training and before matches is unbelivable. I had a lot of coaches but I have to put Mikel as one of the best coaches in my career." #afc

                    I never call your name, but you are in me like the song in the nightingale's throat even when it's not singing.

                    whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. 

                    "Everyone knows he is one of the reasons why I'm still at this club. I have a very good relation ship with him and he's helping me day by day, on the pitch, outside the pitch, and I'm very thankful for him because if you have one coach who gives you the confidence and freedom, it's more easy for the player."

                    "After this season, I have two years left of my contract. I still love this club. I believe Mikel is building a great team. And I want to achieve something special here." Lucky for Xhaka, it seems that Arteta loves him, too.
